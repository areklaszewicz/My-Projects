# Veteran Work Support Project

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to analyze veterans' data from all counties across the United States and identify the 100 counties with the highest need for employment programs supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs. This analysis will involve investigating various factors that may inform in which counties these programs will most effectively improve employment outcomes.
